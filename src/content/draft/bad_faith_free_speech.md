#  Vulnerabilities in a Free Speech Paradigm

Like any computing platform, free speech has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. I'm a free speech proponent, of course. It brings so many great things and is one of the main reasons the USA has set itself apart institutionally from other countries, developed or not. But I am honest with the limitation on free speech that already exist in our society as part of that institution and that there exist yet more exploits of free speech that have not been patched as of today. 

It's not controversial to point out that there are already restrictions on speech in certain situations: 
- One cannot yell "Fire!" in a crowded building.
- One cannot threaten judicial staff during a trial
- One cannot disclose private identifying information of others without their consent
- Attorney-Client priviledge compels no speech by the attorney in certain situations
- etc.

But free speech maximalists who want to see no restrictions whatsoever will often argue that it's a tradeoff between safety and risk for freedom and the inventiveness and creativeness that springs from that.

But upon further examination of that proposition I think they are presenting a strawman, as virtually no liberal pundit is arguing for a clamp down on speech to increase safety at the expense of freedom because they thoroughly understand how that tradeoff is at work there.

Instead, there is a third dimension that the free speech maximalists seem to be ignoring which liberal pundits do take account of. And that is bad faith speech, which is probably best analogized in computer science terms as an exploit in the free speech algorithm or platform, if you will.

What do I mean by bad faith speech? It's speech that is meant gum up the system, for lack of a better term. The so called "Flooding the zone" approach. It's speech that is not meant to persuade, but instead is meant to overload the capacity for analysis. Much like a DNS attack in computing.

# Bad Faith Speech as a DNS Attack Exploit

The gish gallop, flooding the zone, sea-lioning, gas lighting. These are modes of speech that actually use free speech in pursuit of hindering net free speech.

Free speech maximalists typically are not going around arguing in support of fully open APIs and allowing DNS attacks as mere the cost of an open internet, right? They agree that web services may enforce rules to protect their services from being taken down by DNS attacks.

I'd argure that that very same dynamic is at play today in the free speech realm. Historically, this mode of attack was not practically possible due to natural rate-limiting of verbal speech and print media. But with digital media, there is essentially no rate-limiting naturally built into free speech anymore, unless you count the computing capacity of a clandestined state operation a "limit."
