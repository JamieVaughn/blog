# Nature, Nuture, Ancestor

A perenial debate rages about whether nature or nuture is more determinative to one's development, but this reduces the question far too much. We need more precise categories of developmental influence to become the norm. 

So I propose adding ancestor to the nature-nuture dichotomy, so that genes and heritable things (ancestor) may be distinguished from environmental things (nature). Meanwhile nuture remains intact as the category of tings that are taught, but not inherited biologically, essentially culture.
