# WASM's Killer App

WASM has been getting a lot of attention for being a close to the metal language that could potentially displace javascript in the browser. Some believe it could unlock the freedom and capacity for javascript-averse developers to use other languages to write web browser UI's in any server-side language they choose and then use WASM as the compile target.

And that is possible, but I'd argue it may counter-intuitively be yet another reason that javascript becomes more popular not less.

That's because I think WASMs first really killer app will be bringing Machine Learning into the client, not as a compile target to bring web UI's to server languages. And javascript will remain as the interop or glue code language for those in-client ML models.
